# PGR209 Backend programming

Welcome to [this course in Backend Programming at HÃ¸yskolen Kristiania](https://www.kristiania.no/studieportal/school-of-economics-innovation-and-technology/bachelorniva/pgr209/backendprogrammering/). In this course, you will take the step from having learned the syntax and structure of programming into learning how to think and work effectively with code together with others. Through the course, we will be developing and deploying a web application in Java EE using the Servlets API.

The correct times and locations for all lectures is in [Timeedit](https://cloud.timeedit.net/kristiania/web/student/)

## Understanding the course

*I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand* - Confucius

This is a course that may take you by surprise as you first encounter it. I will spend very little time in the beginning explaining technologies and concepts. Instead, I will show you how to do it and give you exercises on using the technologies together with other students. In the beginning you will feel like you're copying without understanding. Only after you have felt how things work, will they be thoroughly explained. Doing something before you fully understand it feels disorienting to many, but ultimately to learn technology, you have to use it.

In the course, you will get to practice building a realistic application using effective development techniques.

Each lecture will consist of 2 hours teaching/demonstration, 2 hours self-practice and 2 hours repetition.
